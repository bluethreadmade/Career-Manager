  "description": "## Introduction This is a project to build a career management tool for individuals and organizations. The tool is intended to help individuals keep track of all their career accomplishments, tailor their resume to specific job postings, and keep them ready to apply at any moment. We intend to prevent that 'oh crap now I need to put my resume back together' moment for everyone. Below are some of our high level user stories: - As a worker I find taking charge of my career to be challening. I want to keep my resume up to date so that when I see opportunities I can go for them, but it's challening to keep track of all my accomplishments and the metrics that make great bullet points. Actively searching for a job is also hard becuase I want to tailor my resume to each post. I also want to keep track of my applications and their outcomes.",
